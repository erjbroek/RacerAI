## Features

- **Track Drawer**: Design and customize your own racing tracks with an intuitive drawing interface.
- **AI Learning Algorithms**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to evolve the behavior of AI-controlled cars:
  - **Genetic Algorithm**: Inspired by natural selection, evolve car behaviors over generations, gradually improving racing skills through simulated evolution.
  - **Work in progress - NEAT Algorithm**: Employ NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to enable cars to evolve behavior and structure of their neural networks, allowing for the emergence of more sophisticated driving strategies.
- **Dynamic Racing Experience**: Watch as AI cars learn from each race, continuously improving their driving strategies and performance.
